# Day 6

## What I did

Today I'm quite satisfied because I added lots of opcodes. I'm at 47% of the work done!

I added the following opcodes:

- EQ
- ISZERO
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- NOT
- SHL
- SHR
- SAR

## To Do

Just want to add more opcodes. And if I have time, I'd like to refactor a bit the code in relation to
handling negative numbers using two's complement. Right now every opcode that has to handle with
signed integers contains some duplicated code and I'd like to reduce it.
