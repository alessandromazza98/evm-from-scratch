# Day 4

## What I did

I added the following opcodes:

- ADDMOD
- MULMOD

I struggled a little in the beginning because I didn't know the first operation is not supposed to be `mod 2^256`.

I spent some time on it and managed to add those opcodes successfully, but didn't have time to add other opcodes today.

## To Do

Just add new opcodes.
