# Day 4

## What I did

Today I'm quite satisfied because I added lots of opcodes. I'm at 33% of the work done!
(yeah, I know the hard part comes near the end).

I added the following opcodes:

- EXP
- SIGNEXTEND
- SDIV
- SMOD
- LT
- GT
- SLT
- SGT

It was very interesting because I had to tackle and study again some things I had previosly studied in my Univeristy,
such as two's complement and signed extension.

## To Do

Just want to add more opcodes. I don't have anything particular I'd like to add or refactor now.
