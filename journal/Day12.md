# Day 12

## What I did

Today I added the following opcodes:

- CREATE
- SELFDESTRUCT

And... the challenge ends here! All tests pass!

## In the end

I won't actually implement the improvements I wrote in yesterday's `To Do` list because it's better to re-write
the entire project a second time, doing it better.

With "better" I mean a different approach, more structured and with a focus on real-EVM use cases.
The best way to do it is to strictly follow the Ethereum Yellow Paper or to use an existing EVM implementation,
such as go-ethereum EVM or Revm (written in Rust) as an example to use as inspiration.

By the way, I am already quite satisfied since I was able to pass all the tests and I learnt a lot about the
EVM and all its in-depth details.
