# EVM From Scratch

Hello everone. This is a fork of the famous `evm-from-scratch` template project made by [w1nt3r-eth](https://github.com/w1nt3r-eth).

## Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to build an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) from scratch using Rust.

This repository contains an [`evm.json`](./evm.json) file with more than 100 test cases that my code must pass for the challenge to be considered successful.

## Credits

All the materials for the template in the repository are made by [w1nt3r.eth](https://twitter.com/w1nt3r_eth).

All the materials for the actual implementation of the EVM in Rust are made by [Alessandro Mazza](https://twitter.com/crypto_ita2).
